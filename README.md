## ðŸ’Ž Hi, I'm Michelle and I'm ready to code! ðŸ’Ž

I'm a former bio-research tech, turned code cruncher and bug slayer. My first programming languages were HTML and CSS when I was thirteen. I wanted to design a pretty page for my Neopets guild, so I taught myself what I needed to know. I enjoy solving problems from a logical perspective. I decided to make the switch to web development because I realized I was more interested in the tech and web dev is the hot market to be in.

I'm currently looking for exciting opportunities as a full stack developer. Check me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-kontoff-149866132/)!

### [Babeling Book](https://babelingbook.herokuapp.com/)
(Flask, SQLAlchemy, ReactJS)

*A single-page blogging site with posts and comments || solo project*
- Constructed a React Context for comments component and its children that shows dynamic, immediate updates when changes are made to comments for increased app responsiveness.
- Implemented responsive CSS media queries for smooth viewing on almost any screen size.
- Designed RESTful APIs and relational database models that enable easy querying of posts and other data from an organized PostgreSQL database.

### [PokeProbe](https://pokeprobe.herokuapp.com/)
(Express, Sequelize, Pug, JavaScript)

*Product Hunt clone where users catch hybrid Pokemon and make profiles for them*
- Manipulated the DOM to implement frontend validation of forms, ensuring input data was not lost by the page refreshing on submit, making form submission easy and smooth for the user.
- Implemented a search bar that queries the database for trainers and pokemon whose name, parent species, or element match the search term for user convenience.
- Developed a complex relational database that links hybrid pokemon to their parent species, their parentsâ€™ elemental types, and their trainers.

### [SpudHub](https://spudhub.herokuapp.com/)
(Flask, SQLAlchemy, ReactJS)

*A single-page Etsy clone to buy and sell produce*
- Spearheaded quality of life implementation of a dynamically updating shopping cart that utilizes Redux and local storage so cart contents can be loaded after the page is refreshed, or the user is re-authenticated.
- Designed Flask model relationships that link orders and the products therein through an order details joins table, which sets products as a property of order, resulting in more detailed queries of order history.
- Built custom React hooks to handle shopping cart CRUD functionality and keep code DRY.
