## ðŸ’Ž Hi, I'm Michelle and I'm ready code! ðŸ’Ž

I'm a former bio-research tech, turned code cruncher and bug slayer. My first programming languages were HTML and CSS when I was thirteen. I wanted to design a pretty page for my Neopets guild, so I taught myself what I needed to know. I enjoy solving problems from a logical perspective. I decided to make the switch to web development because I realized I was more interested in the tech and web dev is the hot market to be in.

I'm currently looking for exciting opportunities as a full stack developer. Check me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-kontoff-149866132/)!

## Projects

### [Babeling Book](https://babelingbook.herokuapp.com/)
(Flask, SQLAlchemy, ReactJS)
*A single-page blogging site with posts and comments || solo project*
- Constructed a React Context Provider that fetches and stores a postâ€™s comments that enables the comment subcomponents to universally access to the list of comments and fetch the new list when comments are edited or added
- Incorporated local storage to remember whether the sidebar was open when the user refreshes the page or navigates backwards for a fluid user experience
- Implemented classy slide-in effect for the sidebar on login and sign up that incorporates React state and CSS transitions for improved aesthetic

### [SpudHub](https://spudhub.herokuapp.com/)
(Flask, SQLAlchemy, ReactJS)
*A single-page Etsy clone to buy and sell produce || group project*
- Spearheaded implementation of a shopping cart that utilizes local storage and the Redux store to dynamically update and save its contents, so they can be loaded them even when the page refreshes or after the user logs out then in again
- Designed Flask model relationships that link orders and the products therein through an order details joins table, which sets products as a property of order, thereby streamlining queries and displaying a userâ€™s order history
- Built custom React hooks to handle shopping cart CRUD functions which keep code DRY.

### [PokeProbe](https://pokeprobe.herokuapp.com/)
(Express, Sequelize, Pug, JavaScript)
*Product Hunt clone where users catch and make profiles for the Pokemon they catch || group project*
- Manipulated the DOM to implement frontend validation of forms, ensuring input data was not lost by the page refreshing on submit
- Incorporated event listeners to dynamically update the caught Pokemonâ€™s name on the screen as the user typed it
